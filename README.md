# Effective Feature Toggling

This is the source code for my Effective Feature Toggling presentation. Please
feel free to take a look around and see how it all came together.

## Tools

- [Remix](https://remix.run/)
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [Monaco Editor](https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/)
- [Mermaid JS](http://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/)
- [LaunchDarkly](https://launchdarkly.com/)

## Running locally

From your terminal:

```sh
npm run dev
```

Then open http://localhost:3000 in your browser of choice (I haven't tested it
in anything other than Chrome though).
